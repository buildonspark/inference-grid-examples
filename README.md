# Inference Grid on Spark

The Inference Grid is a decentralized inference network backed by Bitcoin's Lightning Network. And Spark is the best way to connect to the Lightning Network.

## Examples
For this event, we've prepared a few examples of how to connect to the Inference Grid.

 - [OpenAI Adapter](./adapter) - This is a CLI tool that runs on your server and provides a OpenAI-compatible API endpoint! It helps you get started with the Inference Grid and Spark while maximizing compatibility with existing libraries.

 - [Native Web Client](./nativeweb) - This is a simple web client that allows you to connect to the Inference Grid directly from your browser. It's a good choice if you're building a web app or want your users to pay for inference requests directly from their own Spark wallet.

 - [Spark IG SDK](./spark-ig-sdk) - This is a TypeScript SDK that provides a simple interface for making chat requests to the Inference Grid. It's used by the native web client example and you can use it in your own project!

Check them out, build on them, and let us know what you want to see next!
