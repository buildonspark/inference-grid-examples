# Inference Grid on Spark

The Inference Grid is a decentralized inference network backed by Bitcoin's Lightning Network. And Spark is the best way to connect to the Lightning Network.

## Examples
For this event, we've prepared a few examples of how to connect to the Inference Grid.

 - [Chat CLI](./chat-cli) - This is a simple CLI which shows how to handle streaming responses.

 - [Agent Python](./agent-python) - This is a straightforward example of how to plug the OpenAI compatible interface into PydanticAI.

 - [Tool Use JS](./tool-use-js) - This is a basic example showing how to use tools with the Inference Grid SDK.

Check them out, build on them, and let us know what you want to see next!
